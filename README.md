# Pink Archive

Pink Archive is a full-stack e-commerce platform built with **Spring Boot, Stripe Checkout, and MySQL**.  
The system provides secure payment processing, product inventory management, and an admin dashboard for managing products and orders.

The project was developed to demonstrate backend architecture, secure payment integrations, and real-world e-commerce workflows using modern Java frameworks.

# Architecture:
Client (Browser)
        │
        │ HTTP Requests
        ▼
Spring Boot Application
        │
        ├── Controllers
        │      ShopController
        │      CheckoutController
        │      StripeWebhookController
        │      AdminController
        │
        ├── Services / Business Logic
        │      Cart (session model)
        │      Stripe payment flow
        │
        ├── Persistence Layer
        │      JPA Repositories
        │

        │
        ├── products
        ├── variants
        ├── orders
        └── order_items
```

The application follows a **layered architecture** where:

- HTTP requests are handled by **Spring MVC controllers**
- Business logic is managed within the application layer
- Data persistence is handled via **Spring Data JPA repositories**
- Data is stored in a **MySQL relational database**

```

- **Product** stores the main product information.
- Each product has multiple **Variants** representing different sizes and stock levels.
- When a purchase occurs, an **Order** record is created.
- Each order contains **OrderItems** representing the individual products purchased.

# Payment Flow

Customer
   │
   ▼
Add Product to Cart
   │
   ▼
CheckoutController
   │
   ▼
Stripe Checkout Session Created
   │
   ▼
Customer Pays on Stripe
   │
   ▼
Stripe Webhook (checkout.session.completed)
   │
   ▼
StripeWebhookController
   │
   ├── Mark order PAID
   └── Decrement inventory
```

The checkout flow works as follows:

1. A customer adds products to their shopping cart.
2. The `CheckoutController` creates a Stripe Checkout session.
3. The customer completes payment securely through Stripe.
4. Stripe sends a webhook event (`checkout.session.completed`).
5. The `StripeWebhookController` verifies the webhook, marks the order as **PAID**, and updates inventory.
